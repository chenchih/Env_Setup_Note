# How to Use SSH with key

This guide will show you how to use SSH, including how to generate keys and connect without a password. We'll cover two common methods:
- case1: generate under local side (clinet), this is mostly used for most people 
- case2: generate under server side, I recentely study this method. 
### Getting Started

First, make sure you have the SSH package installed on your system. You can do this with the following command:
```
sudo apt install openssh-server
```
### Understanding SSH Keys

When you use the key to connect server, you will need a public key, and private key:
- private key: Stored on your local machine and must be kept safe. 
- public key: Can be stored anywhere and is linked to the private key.

This method is use often

	- Local PC: window
	- Server: Ubuntu Desktop/Server
	

Let me show most commonly use method when you access to server side with key. You can refer to below picture on diagram

![generate key localside](img/Case1_diagram_generate.png)


### Step1: Generate key under local side(window)
You can either use which algorithms you like `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096` or `ssh-keygen -t ed25519`
Note: recommend use ed25519, but in this example I will show using rsa method.

### Step2: List directory it will generate public and private key


![list generate key](img/case1_publickey.png)


### Step3: copy id_rsa.pub into server, with the `ssh-copy-id` or copy file 

If you use linux it should have the command. 

> Linux
```
ssh-copy-id -i id_rsa.pub root@192.168.1.103
```

> window
```
type %USERPROFILE%\.ssh\id_rsa.pub | ssh chenchih@192.168.1.103 "cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys"
```
![copy public key](img/case1_copypublickey.png)

Note: You can manually copy the `id_rsa.pub` to server side `~/.ssh/` and change the file to `authorized_keys` can also work. 

Let compare public key under local and server side:

![compare public key](img/compare_publickey.png)



### Step4: modify your `sshd_config` to access by key 

> Note: 
>> Ubuntu Server defaults to using SSH keys for remote access via SSH.
>> Ubuntu Desktop defaults to using a password for user authentication and login.
In Ubuntu Desktop default ssh config `PasswordAuthentication` is been set as `yes` which is login with password.

Please modidy `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` and change `PasswordAuthentication no` and restart sshd
```
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config #edit sshd_config
PasswordAuthentication no 

#restart sshd
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```
![edit sshd configure ](img/edit_sshd_config_desktop.png)

### Step 5 connect ssh with key, no password

![login](img/login_key_desktop.png)


Now you can now ssh to server side, but you can put your host IP in config file, so next time no need to type IP address, just modify the config file. 

create file .ssh/config and put these information in it 
```
Host test
    HostName 192.168.1.103
    User chenchih
    Compression yes
```

use the command to ssh server: `ssh test` will make ssh connection without typing long HostName

## <a id="case2"> Case2 generate key under server side  </a> [üîù](#Content)
- Bsic Envirnoment information
	- testserver: client side (172.21.201.107)
	- testserver2:server side (172.21.201.249)

Why would you want to generate under server side? In some case like some devices ex: router, or system developer for some security issue might design user login without password, instead using the private key. User make ssh connection just out the private key in `.ssh` it will connect from client to server.

in this case your client just need a private key it is able to access the server side, so you just copy the private key from server and paste into client and make connection 

Below is the diagram if you generate key under server:
![Case2 generate key under server side ](img/Case2_diagram_generate.png)

### Step 1 ubuntu server generate key
```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
```
![generate key server ](img/server_generate.PNG)

### Step 2 added the public key to authorized_keys
```
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```
![dump public key](img/dump_publickey.PNG)

### Step 3 set permission
```
chmod 700 /home/chenchih/.ssh
chmod 600 /home/chenchih/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 600 /home/chenchih/.ssh/id_rsa   # Only if you copied id_rsa there
chmod 644 /home/chenchih/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

In case if you set using root account to set above permission, please change to normal user, and change ownership and groupship to username

```
sudo chown -R chenchih:chenchih /home/chenchih/.ssh
```

### Step 4 restart ssh 
```
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

### Step 5 copy your id_rsa (private key) into window pc
You have to manual copy like 
```
#server(server) 
cat id_rsa #copy private key
#server2(client)
touch id_rsa
vi id_rsa #paste the private key content
```
you can also download and upload file with ftp or tftp or smb these tool. 

### Step 6 connect ssh from client to server

## <a id="third">Third Party Tool </a> [üîù](#Content)
If you perfer using thridparty tool like putty or terateam, then this is the setting you might need to know else will not be able to connect. 
This method is use on both case 1 and case2, but in my example I use base on case1 as example due to it's common usecase. 

### Use Putty 
If you connect using putty it will pop error "No support authernication methods available" , because putty have it's own private and public key, and I will how how it work. 

![login](img/putty_error.png)

- Step1: open PuTTYgen.exe, if you have install putty it will contain PuTTYgen this tool

- Step2: click load button and choose `id_rsa` your private key
![load private key](img/puttyloadprivate.png)

- Step3: save as private key 
![save putty privatekey](img/saveputtyprivatekey.png)

- Step4: select the psk file and login success
![set psk private key ](img/loginsuccess.png)


this is the method of using thirdparty tool 

### Terateam 
If you use terateam will also have problem, you just follow the step below. 

- Step1: open terateam and click setup>ssh authentication> 
- step2: enter your username and choose the private key 
![terateam set privatekey ](img/terateam_setprivatekey.png)


- step3: connect to server again 
I have set password for private key, if you didn't set password then you can leave as empty. 

![terateam set privatekey ](img/terateam_login.png)


## summary [üîù](#Content)

You can either generate your key on either side:
- generate public and private key on client(often use case, like git)
	- copy public key to server side with name `authorized_keys`

- generate key on server side(use often on devices, not allow user to enter password)
	- dump public key to `authorized_keys` file
	- provide your private key to who want to connect.
